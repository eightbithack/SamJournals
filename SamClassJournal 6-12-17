Ok, I've got my data sorted - the question is where it goes. I'm going to have to alter the load_actionperformed method substantially, since I have a number of image objects that need to be added rather than a direct pull from a separate file. Logically then, the way this will work is that we create a for loop getting the digitalimages, then entering the parameters from the getters for the class to make the class

so the class begins with a filereader, which seems redundant since I'm not using a file as my input but the output of a separate method. So then the process is to construct and downsample the list at the top of the load method inside the for loop. Actually then the first thing should be to take the array of digitimages and work with that then loop through it separately, since I can downsample the individual digitimages using the method inside them that I wrote. Then, I construct the new sampledata using the label of the digitimage to fill in the label of the digitimage. Once I have a sampledata, it should be fine from there.
