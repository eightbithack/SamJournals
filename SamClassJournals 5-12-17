Today I'm going to be watching class 3 while also analyzing the hopfield network code from the book's repository to understand the implications of the code examined


Well, much less note-taking today :) I finally get what a hopfield network is and how it works! I didn't fully grasp the echoing concept till I saw the code myself. While there are some submethods I don't fully understand, the body of the code really helps
Over this weekend and on Monday I really want to finish class three so I don't fall behind
