Today, I'm going to finish class 4

NOTES:
Class 4/16, Part 3/5
Hidden layer, layers between input and output
can change it, somewhat mysterious, since input/output are defined by problem
hidden layer attributes trial and error or algorithms
use pruning to increase efficiency, can't do to input/output
a hidden layer can be changed, but you can't change input/output
the more hidden layers there are, the more complex the solutions would be
2 is for arbitrary decisions
number of hidden neurons should be between the size of the input and output layers
pruning lets you start with a larger number
Class 4/16 Part 4/5
output of feedforward is values times weights plus threshold? for each neuron
output is sum i=o n (inputs * weights)
bunch of specific methods to be reviewed at the conclusion of the class
computeoutput method that does the work for you that takes a 1d array 
I'M SHIFTING NOW TO ANALYZING CODE

So I'm getting deep into the code for feedforward networks, just so I can make sure I have my head wrapped around it
tomorrow I move on to class 5
