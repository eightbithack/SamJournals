Today's goal is simple: finish and take notes on classes 2 and 3 by tomorrow

NOTES: 
Class 2/16 Part 1/5
matrixes are foundation of neural network programming
classes avaible for matrix: BiPolarUtil, Matrix, MatrixMath
bipolar is a way neural networks represent binary numbers with -1 and 1
bipolar to double and vice versa are methods 
matrix has create column/rowMatrix, add, clear, or clone
matrix also has an equal function, a getter for cells/column(s)/rows
also isvector, iszero, set (cell), sum, and toPackedArray to turn matrix into 1D array
matrixmath can add, divide, dotProduct, identity, multiply, subtract, transpose, and vectorLength

Class 2/16 Part 2/5
weight matrices 
weight matrix connecting internal layers
also thresholds in the weight matrix
combination of thresholds and weight values
columns represent output neuron and rows represent input neurons?
threshold values are placed at the bottom, with threshold values going in the column for their output neuron

Class 2/16 Part 3/5
matrix has multiple constructors, ex: new Matrix(rows, columns)
initializes to all zeroes 
can initialize a matrix to normal values when declaring it, feed in 2D array
can create matrixes with a 1D array as well. row matrix is a function (createRowMatrix)
can do the same with columns
