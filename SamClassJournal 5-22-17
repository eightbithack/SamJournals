Today I'm continuing my analysis of genetic algorithms

NOTES: 
Class 5/16 Part 2/5
sets to prevent repitition, cuttting done at random points
mate method called on mother with three chromo inputs?
sometimes you want repeats, so you can have them then with set
for loop that iterates to cutpoint, adds each half for each parent to a child, then adds to taken set
then you flip the loop, this time checking for repeats if necessary
then calculate cost for offspring - with cost being an indicator of the success of the lifeforms, ie error, arbitrary success, etc.
use random numbers and a mutate threshold to randomly ensure mutations for the offspring
Class 5/16 Part 3/5
travelling salesman problem
can't be solved with brute force
FINISHING UP

plan is to hopefully begin figuring out modifications to heaton code that will be necessary for pictogram recognition by Friday, setting out a gameplan for moving forward then
