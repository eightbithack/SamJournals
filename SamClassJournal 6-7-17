Today's the day: downsampling. Obviously this works by taking averages, but I think the best way to do it is to make it so that the data image samples in grids of 2x2. So logically, stuff would happen - see revised digit image class with method included - trick is just to call the class to downsample its own data twice.

Ok downsampler should work. Goal from this point on is to get the bridge working in terms of plugging in the data and ensuring that the input format is correct
