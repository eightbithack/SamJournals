Today I'm watching the example of the XOR gate for implementation, aka class 6

NOTES: 
K, finished xor, moving on to simulated annealing
another way of training feedforward
randomization process that cools off?
based on real-world annealing, metallurgy thing
simulated annealing algortihm is passed starting and ending temp plus number of cycles per iteration
stopping here 410 degrees

I've finished looking at his implementation of xor and started to determine if I'll use genetic algorithms or simulated annealing to train my network.
