Today I'm going to be reading and the example of the traveling salesman from heaton class 5 part 3

NOTES: 
problem gets super complicated as the number of cities increases
genetic algorithm can get 50 cities easier
constant number of genes between chromosomes since constant number of cities
each chromosome represents separate paths with genes being cities
genetic algorithm calculates the cost of the chromosomes, adding them up for total distance and reducing error when needed
create swap points then create temp city to copy over? Ahhh mutatation works by swapping cities in the storage location
part 4
training xor with genetic algorithm
turn weight matirx to 1D and make thme all strung together to make chromosome
each weight matrix'll already have the same length too
do you have a training set is early question
if so, pass in the training data 
main loop is similar to backprop, simulated amealing is similar, can sometimes use hybrid approaches, can free backprop from local minimums where it's stuck
need to implement calculate cost and mutate
uses ratios to do the changes to weights for the string to ensure a similar range but also somewhat different
part 5
making it do tictactoe
creates multiple organisms to play, determines superiority based on w/l, evolves winner
use 1, -1 and 0s to represent x's o's and blanks
then turned into a string
then receive a string telling how favorable the computer thinks the board state is
Class 6 part 1
reviewing the xor implementation,
refer back to this video for the ways to input training data, specifically csv files

Finishing here, I think I understand basically everything I'll need to do my presentation and program - the only thing I'm clueless on is the way to program the input neurons and inputs for analyzing pictograms
so I'm on the lookout for the way to complete that task
